# Terms of Service

Last revised on 05/30/2023

### The Gist

Vortex AI operates the Vortex AI service, which we hope you use. If you use it, please use it responsibly. If you don't, we'll have to terminate your account.

For paid accounts, you'll be charged on a monthly basis. You can cancel anytime, but there are no refunds.

You own the info that you provide to Vortex AI and you're responsible for keeping it safe.

The Terms of Service, Vortex AI itself, and our prices can change at any time. We'll warn you 30 days in advance of any price changes. We'll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of Service or Vortex AI, but we make no guarantees.

That's the basic idea, but You must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with all the details before You use any of our sites (whether or not you have created an account).
